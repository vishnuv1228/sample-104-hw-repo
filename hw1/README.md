### Notes about homework 1:

The important things to include are: where are questions answered/is your code implemented (filenames?). For most questions (but not all), this is determined for you.

How should we compile and run your program? For future homeworks you'll provide a makefile, but for this one you can just list the command(s).

If you want to also provide any test files that you used to test your code (not required), you can create a folder called ```tests``` in this hw1 folder and put them there (and note it in the readme).

In general, it never hurts to be extra clear. Below is a sample formatting, but it can be whatever you want.

* ***General Notes:***
	
	My q1 and q2 answers are in hw1.txt

	My code for q4 is in perm.cpp, and q5 is in lists.cpp (your filenames could be different)

* ***Running the Programs:***
    
    Use ```g++ -g -Wall perm.cpp -o perm``` to create the executable for q4. Run it with ```./perm <string to permute>```.
    
    Use ```g++ -g -Wall lists.cpp -o lists``` to create the executable for q5. Run it with ```./lists <input filename> <output filename>```.
